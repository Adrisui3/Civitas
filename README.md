# Civitas
Simplified version of Monopoly.

This is a university project in which we were practising object-oriented programming.
Consequently, it might contain mistakes both in desing and coding.

I've uploaded a version in Java and another one in Ruby.
Java version includes a graphical user interface, while Ruby version only has a simple text interface.
